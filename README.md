AI-Based Dustbin Management System

This project is an intelligent waste management system that integrates Artificial Intelligence (AI) to optimize the collection and monitoring of waste bins across different divisions and districts. It provides a login portal for corporate users and features AI capabilities for real-time monitoring and automated operations.

Features

1. User Authentication

Login portal for corporate users based on district, ID, and password.

Secure authentication system with role-based access.



2. Division and Dustbin Management

After login, users select the respective division to monitor.

AI detects the filling levels of assigned dustbins in real-time.



3. AI Integration

Automated lid opening mechanism.

Real-time fill-level detection using AI-based sensors and algorithms.

Location mapping of full/near-full dustbins for optimized vehicle dispatch.



4. Backend & Frontend Frameworks

Frontend: EJS (Embedded JavaScript), CSS for UI/UX.

Backend: Express.js for routing and API handling.

AI Module: Python for AI-based sensor integration and data analysis.



Technology Stack

Frontend

HTML/EJS: For dynamic content rendering.

CSS: For styling and responsive design.


Backend

Express.js: Backend framework for handling API requests, routes, and server logic.


AI Module

Python:

AI algorithms for lid automation and fill-level detection.

Libraries like OpenCV or TensorFlow (specify based on your implementation).



Database

(Specify database used, e.g., MySQL, MongoDB, etc., if applicable).

System Workflow

1. Login: Corporate users log in by entering their district, ID, and password.


2. Division Selection: Redirect to a dashboard to select a division.


3. Monitoring:

AI analyzes fill levels of dustbins in the selected division.

Sends notifications with location details of nearly full/full dustbins.



4. Action: Corporate users dispatch vehicles for timely waste collection.


5. Automation:

Lid opens automatically when users approach (sensor-based).

AI ensures efficient and hygienic operations.
